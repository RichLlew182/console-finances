 <p>This was the 4th homework challenge for the EDX Bootcamp in Front End Development.</p> 

   <p>Our task was to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
</p> 

 <p>We were provided with an dataset of months and profits/losses in an array. We had to output:
</p> 

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
